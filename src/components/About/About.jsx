                My name is Tamás Kalapács. I was born and raised in Hungary. In 2016 when I was 18 years old I moved to Denmark to pursue my education.
                During my 4 years of university I grew to like Denmark so much that I decided to stay here.

                Ever since a young age I have been fascinated with figuring out how things work. No wonder that when my family got its first computer my curiosity
                immediately peaked. This led me down on the path of becoming a software developer. Throughout my education I have participated in multiple projects
                as well as two internships. One I spent at a company while I chose to do the other one in a start-up setting.

                I spend my free time doing multiple activities that helped me develop traits that could prove useful in mycarrier.
                My main hobby is playing tactical multiplayer video games with my friends. These games usually require fast paced,
                accurate communication. I also skateboard which heavily revolves around community and it also taught me that anything
                is possible if I spend enough time working on it. Lastly, I have been playing the guitar since I was 6 years old.
                During this time I have been in multiple bands with varying success.
